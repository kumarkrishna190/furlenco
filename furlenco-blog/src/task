Question 1: Write a Web Application (Blogger website), where a user can post blogs
Note: User can perform the following operations:
Adding Blogs
Editing Blogs
List all blogs
Date Filters on Blog
Pagination (mandatory)
There must be a login page and registration functionality included.
A user has his own blog page, where he can add new blog posts. Every authenticated user can comment on posts made by other users. The home page is a paginated list of all posts. **Non-authenticated users can see all blog posts, but cannot add new posts or comment.
** Bonus for adding this particular functionality. An added advantage for clean and modular code.

Backend/Frontend Technologies to be preferred: 
Java, Spring boot, Hibernate, Maven/Gradle, Docker, NodeJS, ReactJS, Postgres
